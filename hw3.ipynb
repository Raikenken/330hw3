    "1. Calling fit_transform on my test data will make it so that we impute the values on the test dataset with the fit also being called on the test data. This is a problem because it will allow us to cheat the training by \"learning\" the values in the test data set. We cannot do this as we assume that during training, we do not have access to the values that we are supposed to predict to prevent leakages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thought not necessarily a worse classifier all the time due to pure luck, it would give us inaccurate evaluations of our model. By not following the Golden Rule, we would not be simulating the real world problem space since we shouldn't be able to see the future data points that we would be running predictions on. This is why we should only train our models on the data that we should be able to access in during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It allows us to chain data processing steps to running the prediction in a model when we give it new data points to call predict on. This saves us the effort of manually performing all the data processing steps before calling a predict. Another advantage is that when doing cross-validation, the pipeline automatically makes it so that fitting for the imputation is done only on the training folds, and only imputation is done on the validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We want to use `ColumnTransformer` When we have different types of transformations that we would like to apply to different columns in a dataset. For example, if we want to apply OneHotEncoder to some columns only, and StandardScaler to some columns only, etc. ColumnTransformer allows us to do these steps in parallel as opposed to using pipelines where we cannot choose which columns a transformation will apply to."
